## Project Members

## Project Description

Create a procedurly generated water based lanscape where you can control a variety of different boats in the water. On the land, there will be random cities and forests, creating a nice landscape to sail around.

## Technical Details

- Procedurly generated landscape (2 points)
- Shadow mapping (2 points)
- Water effect with reflection and refraction (2 points)
  - Water effect with reflection of 3D models (EC if able)
  
## Creative Efforts

- Boat moving in the water to trigger water animations (or even control the boat)
  - larger/smaller waves depending on the speed of the boat
- Boat controls with interesting camera positions
- Adding buildings and shrubbery in an aesthetically pleasing manner on top of random terrain.
  - add in plants/buildings under the water? Similar to a flooded environment
